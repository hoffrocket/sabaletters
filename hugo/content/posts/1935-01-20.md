With God's Allmighty Blessing, Shalom Shlomo <a href="#" title="Love">Chai</a>

I allow myself to reach out to you and ask you some details as I know that you are still “Green” in Palestine and I wish to know everything about the family. A young fellow, Avigdor Stein from Chvarascov, near Tarnopol, founded a factory for soda water in <a href="#" title="Near Tel Aviv">Kfar Saba</a> and a factory for ice in <a href="#" title="North of Tel Aviv">Raanana</a>. He is here a couple of months already and met a young woman for the purpose of <a title="match making"shiduch</a>. Her name is Saltzha. He liked her a lot and his parents heard good things about her. Now my question is how this young fellow is behaving there (In Palestine). I follow your letters and read them with great curiosity. 
God willing that you’ll be a good messenger for your parents and that you’ll create a happy future.

I’ll wait your respond,

Your uncle, Yitzchak
