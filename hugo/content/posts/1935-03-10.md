[dated 1935]

Dear Salo,

I send you 6 pairs of socks, one pair of long socks and 6 handkerchieves with Mr. Vayruch so that during the holidays you’ll be free and you won’t have to bother with mending socks.

At the same opportunity, I wanted to send you something of my Purim delicacies but, to my disappointment, you’ll get the package exactly on Passover so I must <a title="Not kosher for Passover">give it up</a>.

I wish you Salo my dear chag sameach and lots of health and success in life.
I ask you again, as I did in my last letter that you think hard about everything. 
I am very delighted that you are thinking of starting to study. You’ll probably write to us a lot about that. How did you manage and to what faculty did you register? As Aba already mentioned, we’ll help you as much as we can if there will be a need.

I hug you and kiss you strongly,

Your loving mother
