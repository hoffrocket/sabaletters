Dear Salo,

I am just returning from a meeting that took place in regard to establishing <a href="#" title="Fund for strengthening Jewish settlements in Palestine">Keren Ha-ye-sod</a>. The "Zionist youth" arrived in a chorus. From the old "regulars" only Sarah arrived and comrade Vayler from Charumska Street.A representative from Palestine gave a speech and pointed at the courageous stand of the settlers during the recent events. Besides that, elections took place in Tarnopol for the city’s council. The Jews lost 4 mandates because of the split in power. The Jewish opinion now is focused on what’s happening in Palestine and the nervousness is reflected in the results of the votes. When you receive this letter, the results of the discussions would probably be out.

In one of your last letters, you mentioned that possibly you might visit Poland. I would be forever thankful if you could let me know when that might be. With me personally, nothing much is new. We work as usual. Last week, a bunch of families from Tarnopol left for America, including the Gleber family that owned a store in 3rd of May Street. 

Write what’s new with you.

Hearty shalom and kisses

Your brother, Izzo
