Dear <a title="Another nick name for Saba Shlomo">Lumtzu</a>,

I am very happy that you feel good in Palestine and that you are content. I am just worried that
you are not telling us the entire truth so as not to upset us. Because I heard that the situation in
Palestine doesn’t look that rosy. They say that Ms. Tirkel is planning to return to Poland. I don’t
know if that’s true.

With me there’s nothing new. I still don’t have a permanent occupation but I hope that in the
very near future I’ll start something. I am enclosing a picture of my dear <a title="Munyo">son</a>. He is now
eight months old. I made the picture last month. You have no idea how sweet he is and, of
course, I love him very much.

I am also enclosing two pages from your diary to remind you of days past gone. I am just
curious to know what “mathematical game” I taught you on the 16th of April and in what year it
was.

I end with hearty regards,

Your loving brother,

Shmuel
