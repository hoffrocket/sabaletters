<a href="#" title="Pet name for Savta">Dear Dontzya</a>,

I got your postcards from Petach Tikvah and was very happy.
Did you get my letter where I inserted a sample of the wool? I forgot to ask what kind of sleeve you want-- long or elbow length, because here they make mostly elbow length. The dress will be very pretty and perfect for fall. As to the shoes, the measurement you sent isn’t good because the shoemaker has completely different measurements. You have to decide the exact color because here, you can get all the colors. As for the night gown for you. Pepi is writing to the aunt, maybe you’ll be able to get it.

With loving kisses,
Mom
