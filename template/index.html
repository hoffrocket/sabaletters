      My grandparents immigrated to Palestine in the mid thirties from different cities in Poland. They met there and started a life together in a new land. Between 1935 and 1941 they received letters from their <a href="1941-05-13.html">families in Europe</a>, and from <a href="1941-02-01.html">each other</a>. This archive of letters is dedicated to their memory.
