To my dear son, Mr. Shlomo may his candle be lit

This is in answer to your letter that you’re angry at us that we write just a little, and that’s why you hold off and don’t write to us. That’s definitely not true. So I ask that you write a lot. As you can see, our letters got shorter. In my last letter I wrote in details how I arranged things with the business. I <a href="#" title="Licenses were taken away from Jews. Cripples were the only ones who could get license at that time">rented the rights</a> to do business from a cripple and I pay him a monthly fee. We arranged the procedure between us. That cost me a lot of money but it’s good that I got it done.

<a href="#" title="Shmuel, Shlomo's brother">Smultz</a> liquidated his store because they took his license away and he has no job. 

Here’s hoping that God will help him and he’ll find a job.

The whole family sends you regards.

Your father,

Yoel
