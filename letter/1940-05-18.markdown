Postcard To: S. Einleger, Hadassa hospital, Jerusalem, Palestine

To my beloved so, Mr. Shlomo, may his candle be always lit.

WE got your postcard from 3.15 today and it brought us lots of happiness.
 With us, blessed god, everything is fine. They confiscated our apartment and we’ll probably have to leave it. I still don’t know where we’ll go.

 Since 1.11 I don’t work at the store because they took it away from me. I sold the dining room furniture and a couple of other things. I rented an apartment in Skalet and we’ll probably have to move there.
 My son, <a href="#" title="Saba’s brother, real name Shmuel">Miltzu</a> works and earns a living.
 <a href="#" title="Saba’s brother, real name Yitchak">Izo</a> finished his studies at Lumberg.
 <a href="#" title="Saba’s sister">Zonia</a>, may her life be long, completed the 9th grade.

I don’t have more to write. We’re all healthy. My sister, Rivka, visits almost every day. She, god willing, is healthy.

I send you regards, so does the whole family.

Your father,

Yoel.
