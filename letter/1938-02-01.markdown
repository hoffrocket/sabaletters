Dear Salo
 
Dad already wrote to you that on the 18th our cousin Andza is going to Palestine so if you need something that I can send let me know immediately. Here everything is as always <a href="#" title="Saba's other brother">Miltszu</a> opened an office for distribution of newspapers, may God help him.In my previous letter I wrote you about the situation in the universities here. The Hooligans' rampage never stops. The authorities supposingly "punish" the murderers but they never took any major steps. Actually our government "calms" them only when they cause danger to the authorities themselves.and don't give a damn about the beaten Jew. The atmosphere is getting more tense from day to day.Now it's talked about all over the restriction against Kosher slaughter.You probably heard about it. The legislators of this rule in the Parliament argue that they were only thinking of humanitarian reasons, that was proved wrong. But actually they wish to destroy the Jews economically & ethically. I could write much more about this but I'll do that next time. Write to me about social life in Israel.

What's new with you? Are you healthy? How is studies & work? What's new with our relatives? Kurtz & the rest of them?
 
I'm looking forward to your letter & kiss you,

Izo

Happy Purim
