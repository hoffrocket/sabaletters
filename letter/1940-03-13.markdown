Salo my dear,

I let you know that, thank god, we’re all healthy.
As I mentioned to you earlier, we live in the same room with the window facing the yard. We made make shift tin burners and we’re comfortable.
<a href="#" title="Saba’s brother, real name Yitchak">Izo</a> continues to study in Levuv and <a href="#" title="Saba’s sister">Zonia</a> goes to High School. 
  With us, also live three refugees and we get along with them in complete harmony.
  <a href="#" title="Saba’s older brother, real name Schmuel">Miltzu</a> works for good salary.
<a href="#" title="Miltzu and Salka’s baby who probably was around 4 then- Saba tried to find him after the Holocaust through a radio program in Israel that was called, Find Your Relative, but never found him">Munio</a> grew to be a very handsome and smart child.

I kiss you and ask that you answer immediately,

Love you,

Mom
