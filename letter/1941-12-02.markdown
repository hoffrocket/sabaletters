My dearest!

It’s been a long time since we got a letter from you but we hope to get one soon. Here, everything is as it was. How is dear <a href="#" title="Savta">Tzilinkah</a>? Does she write to you?

<a href="#" title="Savta’s sister">Mantzi</a> is healthy and they are doing well. In May, we hope to be Grandma and Grandpa.

I would be delighted to hear that Tzilinkah already got married.

Regards and kisses,
<a href="#" title="Savta's mom">Adella</a>

Regards and lots of kisses, <a href="#" title="Savta's father">Israel</a>
