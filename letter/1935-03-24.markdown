Dear Salo,

In one of our conversations, it came up, by chance, that you are having your birthday around now. So imagine that I am standing in front of you, shaking your hand, kissing your cheek and saying, "Be happy!" 

Put your life on the national altar so that the future doesn’t forget you.

I am saddened by your last letter in which you describe the situation in Palestine. "Everything is in the hands of the Left," that is what your letter says. This helped me understand the situation in Eretz Israel. The Left, in my mind, is prologue to Communism, which in itself is sheer poison.

That doesn’t mean that I entirely justify the right wing Zionists even though I am one of them. You yourself wrote that everyone only thinks about what to eat and how to make a living. These are the first signs of decay, sneaking into Jewish lite in Palestine.

I would write more, a great deal more, but I don’t want to tire you.

We will see each other next year and celebrate your birthday together, within the walls of Old Jerusalem.

I kiss you,

Regards from Klugman and Yoel and from our lady companions, Rozenberg, Reichlin and Weinberg.
