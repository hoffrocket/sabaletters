In God help, to my dear son, the joy of my soul, Mr. Shlomo, may his candle be lit!

As I found out, there will be, in time for Pesach an inexpensive trip from Eretz Israel and it will cost aprox. 7 funt. So I am definitely for it that you’ll come home for Pesach. You’ll be able to deal with the expenses from there and maybe borrow. Also, get from the consulate a certificate that you are a student so that you can take money from here.

I and the entire family kiss you heartly and wish you a kosher Pesach.

Your father.

Salo dear! They are talking here that soon there will be an organized trip to Poland, so we so wish that you’ll take advantage of it and come home for the holidays. We send this via air mail so that you’ll have time to think about everything.

We anticipate with longing and desire to meet you soon.

Kisses and hearty regards,

Loving Mom
