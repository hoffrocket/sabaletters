Salo my love,

First I want to bless you from the bottom of my heart for your birthday. I wish you lots of health, happiness and satisfaction. May God always protect you. I wish so much that I could kiss you and congratulate you in person as I did when you were still with us. I comfort myself with the fact that you have a good job and that you’re well respected and loved, as was always the case.
Here, as father wrote to you, things are not quite working out on our behalf. We hope things will get better when we take a handicapped person as a <a href="#" title="Jews were able to keep a business if they partnered with a handicapped gentile.">partner</a>.
We can still sell large quantities of the tobacco that we purchased earlier. I am just praying to God that father will be healthy and be able to continue working in our business.

We, <a href="#" title="Saba’s brother">Miltzu</a>, and many other Jews applied to Warsaw for a license to sell tobacco and cigarettes . Maybe we’ll get it. Right now we’re in a period of anti-Jewish pogroms but we hope it will pass.

I don’t know if you’re studying at the university so please write to me about this in your next letter.

I end by kissing you from the bottom of my heart, my dear son.

Your loving mother.
